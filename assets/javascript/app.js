// PSUDO CODE FOR TRIVIAL GAME
// THEME: MUSIC ( OR THERE ABOUTS....)

// DIRECTIONS

// 3 rounds of 10 question (ambitious but I’m gonna try)
// Multiple choice or true false for options to answer
// ~make sure user can only select one answer for each question
// 30-60 seconds per question, so countdown clock should limit the game length
// ~when timer runs down, reveal score of game (correct and incorrect)

// Create a form with 10 questions
// 	each question should have options (true/false or ABCD)

// 	EACH QUESTION SHOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO ANSWER ONCE!
// ______at the end when the whole thing is either submitted or times out _____
// 	if the answer selected is correct, add 1++ to score correct
// 	if answer selected is incorrect, add 1++ to score incorrect
// 	if there are answers un-answered when the time runs out, 1++ unanswered

//  Have a timer set up to count down from either 5 min or 10 min (depending on how hard the questions are)
// 	show an alert at 30 second left to warn the player
// 	when the timer runs out,  calculate the accurate scores for correct, incorrect and unanswered
// 	display the score on the page for the player to review at the end of the game 

// ****notes on the video examples****
// Background doesn’t change
// Header/title doesn’t change
// Just information in the middle of the page changes (aka start button/questions/review of answers)
// 		~~could be done using nested containers
// 		~~so that as each thing happens (on click for start button—>changes main container…after answering all the questions or timer running out(alert about timer running down)—>changes main container…
