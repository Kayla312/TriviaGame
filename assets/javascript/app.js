// PSUDO CODE FOR TRIVIAL GAME
// THEME: MUSIC ( OR THERE ABOUTS....)

// DIRECTIONS

// 3 rounds of 10 question (ambitious but Iâ€™m gonna try)
// Multiple choice or true false for options to answer
// ~make sure user can only select one answer for each question
// 30-60 seconds per question, so countdown clock should limit the game length
// ~when timer runs down, reveal score of game (correct and incorrect)
