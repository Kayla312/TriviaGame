// Create a form with 10 questions
// 	each question should have options (true/false or ABCD)

// 	EACH QUESTION SHOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO ANSWER ONCE!
// ______at the end when the whole thing is either submitted or times out _____
// 	if the answer selected is correct, add 1++ to score correct
// 	if answer selected is incorrect, add 1++ to score incorrect
// 	if there are answers un-answered when the time runs out, 1++ unanswered

//  Have a timer set up to count down (depending on how hard the questions are the time length)
// 	show an alert at 30 second left to warn the player
// 	when the timer runs out,  calculate the accurate scores for correct, incorrect and unanswered
// 	display the score on the page for the player to review at the end of the game
